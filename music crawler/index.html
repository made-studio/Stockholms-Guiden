There were no genres exclusive to Sweden that really stod out, only genres like childrens and holiday music that do not tell us anything about Swedens taste for music. Overall Swedens music taste was quite similar to the UK's. </p></div>
    <div class="pane"><b>UK Top 100:</b><p>Pop music and rap/hip-hop was also beloved genres in the UK but dance music and rock was also very common. Electronic music and Afrobeat was also unique genres for the UK. The popularity of dance, electronic and house music could be a reflection of the UK's love for clubbing.</p></div>
